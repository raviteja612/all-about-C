/*This program summarizes how you typedef or define a structure. Use a pointer to such a structure.
Allocate memory to that pointer so that you can define values to those structure members.
you can use other pointers to access these defined members i.e. using a different pointer to point to these defined members.
Display all the addresses and values of each structure members
