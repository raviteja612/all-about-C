Actual steps for cloning, and merging back the changes:
1. Go to github and fork a copy of the project so that it moves from "prats612" to "raviteja612" username
2. Now on Github you have your local copy(raviteja612) from the master prats612
3. git clone "URL" will clone it to your local workspace repo
4. do changes whatever you want to do on those findLongestSubStr
5. git status always helps in understanding what your current status is
6. git add * will add all the untracked pending files
7. git commit -m "your commit message" will commit the changes into your local repo
6. git push will push those changes to the one from wherever you have cloned

With the above changes, you are not linked with the "master" copy. All your changes are in the repo where you cloned.

To always ensure you are in sync with the master copy, i.e. raviteja612 should be in sync with prats612, follow the below URL
follow step 3:

--> do git remote -v and git remote add upstream to create a link between the repo and the upstream

-> git checkout will create a new branch from your master.
The purpose is that you create a local copy devoid of master and make all necessary changes.
Later you can merge from your branch to the main master

-> git pull = git fetch + git merge
i.e it will pull all the changes from the upstream repository

-> pull request happens on the github side (server side) where you the master to make a pull request to merge the local changes with the master copy
